These codes were used to calculate the equlibrium state configurations of 1D Spin vector soliton.

The algorithm is non-linear BFGS optimazation, and was implemented by myself in the matlab envriment. 
These codes run with parallrization calculation acceleration. The shell .sh script was used to control the 
runing state on the super computer.

C++ language was used to implement the labriry, which calculate the "A-Matrix". It is one of the most important 
entity when the configuraion and free energy are discretized with finite element strategy.
